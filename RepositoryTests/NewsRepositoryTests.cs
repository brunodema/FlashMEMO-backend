My wife and I cried for joy, with the silent hope that Mr. Floyd was somewhere in Heaven celebrating the moment with his mother. Five minutes into our tear-fest I received a call from Phil Dixon, who along with his wife Cathy are two of my closest friends in the world. I heard Phil’s voice, and I broke down in tears again as I heard him quietly sobbing.Phil and I met each other in 2004.Phil is from London, England; he’s twenty some odd years older than me, and I forgot to mention that he’s white. I’m from this little suburb called Bridgeton, which is right outside of St. Louis, Missouri; I’m forty-seven, and I forgot to mention that I’m Black. We are literally from opposite ends of the planet with completely different life experiences, and yet we have forged a friendship that has weathered the highs and lows of business, life, this thing called Race in America, and everything in between.",
